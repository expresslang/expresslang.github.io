  The official account of EXPRESS history, by its founders!

This is the official account of the EXPRESS language family, written and
confirmed by the original team of EXPRESS inventors/developers: Doug Schenck,
Bernd Wenzel, Joe Eggers and Peter Wilson.


== Creation of EXPRESS


Douglas Schenck and Peter Wilson published the authoritative reference to the
EXPRESS language named
https://global.oup.com/academic/product/information-modeling-the-express-way-9780195087147["`Information Modeling: The EXPRESS Way`"]
in 1994, with several anecdotes of how EXPRESS was initially conceived:

[quote,"Information Modeling: The EXPRESS Way"]
____
The name EXPRESS (which is supposed to conjure up the idea of expressiveness)
was coined in Zurich in the spring of 1986 when Bernd Wenzel and [Doug] first
started working on the problem.
____

[quote,"Information Modeling: The EXPRESS Way"]
____
Peter Wilson developed EXPRESS-G and EXPRESS-I.
____


== Birth of EXPRESS (1982)

The PDDI program was created in 1982 by the https://www.airforce.com[US Air Force]
at the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas[McDonnell Douglas Corporation],
headed by Douglas Schenck (of McDonnell Aircraft).

A data modelling language was developed in PDDI called  "`PDDI DSL`" (Data
Specification Language).

Joe Eggers (of McDonnell Aircraft) with Doug developed the first parsers and
compilers.

NOTE: At one point, the PDDI DSL was called the "`Doug Schenck Language`".


== EXPRESS in NBS (1984)

As part of the https://www.nist.gov[NBS (now NIST)]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303[STEP] effort,
PDES was created under the IGES organization within NBS.

PDDI DSL was transitioned into the PDES organization within NBS as the PDDI
program was mostly completed in 1985.

NSB hosted the first https://www.iso.org/committee/54158.html[ISO/TC 184/SC 4]
meeting in July 1984, and served as the the SC4 Secretariat on behalf of
https://www.ansi.org[ANSI] until December 1998.

NOTE: NBS was renamed to  "`NIST`" in 1988.

NOTE: The NBS PDES organization was succeeded by https://pdesinc.org[PDES, Inc].


== Coinage of EXPRESS (1986)

Douglas Schenck and Bernd Wenzel (of GEMAP MbH, Munich, FRG) named the language as
"`EXPRESS`" in Jan 1986.

Joe Eggers worked closely with Doug and Bernd to ensure the language was readily
machine-processable.

NBS (via Doug Schenck) submitted the "EXPRESS - A Language for Information
Modeling" document in 1986 Jan to ISO/TC 184/SC 4/WG 1 as N119.


== EXPRESS in ISO (1986)

NBS (via Doug Schenck) submitted an updated EXPRESS specification as
ISO TC 184/SC4/WG 1 N177.

NOTE: This submission is made available by NIST at
https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/IR/nistir88-4004p4.pdf[NIST IR 88-4004 Part 4].


== EXPRESS in ISO (1988)

Douglas Schenck submitted through NBS the "`PDES Test Draft`" to
ISO/TC 184/SC 4/WG 1 as N268 (non-LaTeX) and then N287 (LaTeX formatted).

STEP file structure (also called  "`physical file`"), also inspired by the PDDI
effort, was submitted as N279.

== Birth of EXPRESS-G (1989/90)

Peter Wilson (Boeing) created EXPRESS-G in 1989, which was formalized in 1990.

[quote,Peter Wilson,"Information Modeling: The EXPRESS Way"]
____
It didn't take long as I was the only one doing it so there were no heated discussions.
____

It was accepted by ISO at the same time as EXPRESS itself.

.Description of when EXPRESS-G was created, according to Peter Wilson

== Birth of EXPRESS-I (1991/92)

EXPRESS-I came a little later. A language for describing instances of
information models.

The language is described in the "Information Modeling: The EXPRESS Way".
It was never standardized at ISO.


== EXPRESS accepted as an International Standard at ISO (1994)

The book "`Information Modeling: The EXPRESS Way`" by Douglas Schenck and Peter
Wilson, was published by Oxford University Press (1994), which covers
EXPRESS, EXPRESS-G and EXPRESS-I.

EXPRESS and EXPRESS-G were published as
https://www.iso.org/standard/18348.html[ISO 10303-11:1994],
"`Industrial Automation Systems and Integration -- Product data representation and exchange`".

References for EXPRESS, EXPRESS-G, EXPRESS-I and EXPRESS-X were published.

== EXPRESS International Standard updated at ISO (2004)

David Loffredo (of STEP Tools) and Peter Wilson (of Boeing) led the update to
https://www.iso.org/standard/38047.html[ISO 10303-11:2004], "`Industrial Automation Systems And Integration - Product Data Representation And Exchange - Part 11: Description Methods: The EXPRESS Language Reference Manual`"

== Summary

The inventors of EXPRESS with ELF will be carrying this history of the EXPRESS
languages forward.
