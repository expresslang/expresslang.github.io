ELF serves organizations and individuals alike with a need in defining
interchangeable information models across information systems.

ELF membership is open to all parties internationally through an annual
donation.

* Corporate membership enables the participation of corporate
staff in ELF technical committees with voting rights.

* Individual membership enables participation in technical committees and
working groups in expert capacity.

* Founding membership carries the same benefits as corporate membership
but does not carry the requirement of an annual donation.

For membership inquiries, please contact link:mailto:info@expresslang.org[us].
